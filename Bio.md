## About Me
I am a computational biologist, my research interests include botany, climate science, and agricultural biotechnology. 

I grew up in Houston, Texas, a city I have seen ravaged by hurricanes and 1,000-year flooding events multiple times in my childhood. I fell in love with biology and ecology in my time working at the Houston Zoo during high-school. When I went to Texas Tech for my undergrad I immediately joined a lab and for 3 years worked as an undergaduate research scholar in the Olson Lab studying tree genetics and the evolution of tree chromosomes. In the final year in the lab, I started my first computational project, and unexpectedly absolutely loved coding. It felt like a puzzle and satisfied me in a way no other research had. So I stayed at Texas Tech and continued to learn to code, and apply computer science and mathematics to botany. This led me to write my thesis, "Optimal Acclimation of C_4_ photosyntheis shows limited response to CO_2_" in the Smith lab. This work is now published in the Global Change Biology Journal. 

I now work for a private Research and Development company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, BBN Techgnologies. I am a computational biologist and bioinformaticist working mainly on genetic engineering projects that come out of the US Department of Defense, though am always searching for ways to bring botany and agriculture to BBN. 

I am passionate about science communication to the public and science advocacy in American politics. I am especially interested in how climate change will impact international relations as we move into this brave new world.
