           <h3>Modeling Photosynthesis</h3>
           <p> I am interested in understanding how plants adjust physiologically to environmental changes.
           I developed a theory of physiological acclimation to environmental change for plants that use the
           C4 photosynthetic pathway. Check out the results of my model <a href="results.html">here</a>.
           examine the mechanisms underlying these responses from the leaf to the whole plant.</p>
           <h3>Microbial Biogeochemistry</h3>
           <p>My goal is to understand the ecology and evolution of ocean microbes and how they influence
           global biogeochemical cycles. I focus on the cyanobacterium <i>Prochlorococcus</i>, which is the smallest
           and most abundant microbe in ocean ecosystems — sometimes accounting for half the total
           photosynthetic biomass. I use this model system to study life across all scales — from the genome
           to the ecosystem. </p>
           Of all microbial biogeochemistry, to study, I found marine microbes the most fascinating because of the enormous
           effect they have on the ocean, and the dependency of all life on biodiversity in the oceans.

           <h3>Synthetic Ecology</h3>
           <p>Synthetic biology is at a stage similar to that of computer science in the 1950’s: The
           foundational pieces are starting to emerge, in the form of standardized DNA parts, packaged for
           combinatoric assembly using standards such as BioBricks. However, creating new DNA parts is tedious
           and time-consuming, and constructing systems from sets of DNA parts is an ad hoc, manual process
           that limits the size, complexity, and capability of the resulting systems. <b>The time is right for
           automation of biological design</b>.</p>
